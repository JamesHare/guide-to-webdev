Before jumping right into Web Development, it's important to know how the World Wide Web (WWW) works. Here's a very quick explination.

The web works because of the Internet. When a web browser requests a document via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the webserver hosting the website returns the HTML document through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
